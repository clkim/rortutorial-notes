h2. Section:

h3. 2.3.5 Deploying the demo app
  * [Typo/Clarification] Should be able to do @$>git commit -m "Finish demo app"@ instead of the
  @$>git commit -a -m "Finish demo app"@ in the Tutorial, since had just done in previous step @$>git add .@ 
  
  * Extra credit: After finishing migration of the production database on Heroku, did following to actually run the app on Heroku
  @$>heroku run rails server@
  ** In browser, go to http://xxxxx-yyyyy-nnnn.herokuapp.com/users
  *** replaced xxxxx-yyyyy-nnnn with heroku app name
  ** It works! COOL! (Shut down the rails server with Ctrl-C)
