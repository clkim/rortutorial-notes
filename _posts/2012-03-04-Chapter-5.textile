h2. Section:

h3. 5.3.1 Route tests
* [Clarification] I had done exercise #2 in Chapter 3, Section 3.5. So, Listing 5.15 and Listing 5.19 would be <code>text: "#{base_title} | Contact"</code>  instead of  <code>text: "Ruby on Rails Tutorial Sample App | Contact"</code>

h3. 5.4.2 Signup URI
Running all specs in a directory
* Even though Windows path uses backslash when I do autocompletion of path by using 'tab', e.g.
	@$>bundle exec rspec spec\requests\user_pages_spec.rb@ which runs ok, to run all the request specs by passing the whole directory, I had to use the forward slash, e.g.
** @$>bundle exec rspec spec/requests/@	- ok
** @$>rspec spec/requests/@							- ok (with the set up in Section 3.6.1 Eliminating bundle exec)
** @$>bundle exec rspec spec\requests\@	- error message: ... in `block in gather_directories': too short escape sequence (ArgumentError)
** @$>rspec spec\requests\@							- same ArgumentError error message
** @$>bundle exec rspec spec\requests/@	- no tests ran: No examples found
** @$>rspec spec\requests/@							- no tests ran: No examples found
** @$>bundle exec rspec spec/@					- ok
** @$>rspec spec/@											- ok
* Some other command permutations:
** @$>bundle exec rspec spec/requests@	- ok
** @$>rspec spec/requests@							- ok
** @$>bundle exec rspec spec@						- ok
** @$>rspec spec@												- ok	
** @$>bundle exec rspec spec\requests@	- no tests ran: No examples found
** @$>rspec spec\requests@							- no tests ran: No examples found
* Running @$>bundle exec rake spec@ at this point in Tutorial produces error message: C:/Sites/rails_projects/sample_app/db/schema.rb doesn't exist yet. Run `rake db:migrate` to create it then try again. ...
* [Typo] The 'Sign up' page styling at this point is not what is shown in Figure 5.10. but is similar to styling in Figure 5.9.

h3. 5.4.3 Deploying to production with Blueprint
* Had to update Gemfile to use latest point release instead of fixed 'i.j.k' version of following gems
** gem 'sass-rails',   '~>3.2.3'
** gem 'coffee-rails', '~>3.2.2'
** gem 'jquery-rails', '~>2.0.0'
